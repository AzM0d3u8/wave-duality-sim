# Wave-Particle Duality Simulation

This simulation demonstrates the **double-slit experiment**, showing the dual nature of light or electronsâ€”behaving as particles or waves.

## Features

- Two modes: **Wave** (interference pattern) and **Particle** (random scatter).
- Real-time visualization of particles hitting a detector screen.
- Adjustable parameters in `config.py`.

## Controls

- `SPACE` - Toggle between wave and particle mode.
- `R` - Reset the simulation.

## Run Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the simulation:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
